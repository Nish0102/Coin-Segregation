# 🪙 Coin Segregation System (Hardware Project)

An embedded system that identifies and categorizes coins based on their physical radius, and automatically sorts them into designated containers.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To build an automated system capable of detecting different coin types using their size, and separating them into the correct compartments without manual intervention.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- A physical sensor setup detects the **radius of coins** as they pass through a measurement unit.
- Based on the detected radius, coins are **classified by denomination**.
- Servo motors or actuators direct the coin into the appropriate box.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: Arduino UNO
- **Sensors**: IR Sensor for radius detection
- **Actuators**: Servo motors for physical sorting
- **Platform**: Arduino IDE

## 🧠 My Contribution

- Designed the logic for radius-based classification
- Calibrated sensor values for different coin sizes
- Worked on integrating the actuator mechanism for sorting
- Contributed to overall hardware testing and debugging

## 📦 Project Status

✅ Completed — prototype tested successfully on multiple coin types  
🚫 Code not available due to hardware-level execution and device constraints
